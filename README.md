1. Planning the App
Define the features: Basic features might include current weather, a 5-day forecast, and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
Design the layout: Sketch a simple UI/UX design. Decide how the data will be displayed.

3. Setting Up the Project
Create the file structure: Typically, you’ll have an index.html, a styles.css for styling, and a script.js for JavaScript.
Link your files: Ensure your HTML file correctly links to your CSS and JS files.

4. HTML Structure
Create the basic structure of your webpage in index.html. This includes:
A search bar for user input (city name).
A section for displaying the current weather.
A section for displaying the weather forecast.

5. Styling with CSS
Use styles.css to style the app. Ensure it's responsive and user-friendly.
Consider using Flexbox or Grid for layout.
Use weather icons for a more visual representation.

6. Fetching Weather Data
API selection: Choose a weather API. OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI are popular options.
API key: Sign up and get an API key.
Fetch data: Use JavaScript’s fetch function to get weather data from the API.

7. Processing and Displaying Data
Extract necessary data from the API response (e.g., temperature, weather description).
Update the DOM elements with this data.

8. Handling User Input
Add an event listener to the search bar to trigger a function when the user submits a city name.
Fetch and display weather data for the entered city.
